Tableau Analysis

I reviewed summer data for each of 2017, 2018 and 2019 (June-August). Here are findings of note.

1. The commuting times of day were consistent with my hypothesis of "rush hour" times.
2. The one exception to the first point was that commuting times for women differed greatly from men and those who did not identify. Women had higher rates of bike use from 12-4 than the morning peak of 8 am. This was consistent with all age groups. 
3. For summer months, June and August saw higher rates of bike use than July. This may be tied to July being a popular month for vacation but requires further exploration.
4. The start and end stations were consistent for use regardless of gender or age.
5. On a simple level, there wasn't any clear pattern of growth year over year, but this is just summer data only. I would want to review a longer period of time with all 12 months in each to draw a more meaningful conclusion.
